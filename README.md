Aquaponics system

This is an automated aquaponics system that uses sensors to display the status of maintainance needed for the system. The status is displayed on an LCD screen and sent to a web server to display the information on the website and the mobile app. The intel edison board was used as the controller for the system, its ability to have an onboard wifi communication and arduino compatability made it a good choice.
